```ts
import { UsiTextModule } from 'usi-campfire/text';
```

# Text
The text module was created as an easy way to apply Campfire text formatting to your application. This way, all text, especially tedious text formatting, can
be easily applied to your application. Text formatting can be applied to any valid HTML tag. This is done using an Angular directive. This way, we are able to
keep semantic meaning in our HTML.

```html
<p usi-text>Paragraph Text Content</p>
<span usi-text>Span Text Content</span>
<a href="#" usi-text>Anchor Text Content</a>
```

## Alignment
To make aligning text easier, Campfire comes with an alignment attribute. This attribute can be used to align text to the left, center, right, or even
justify it.

```html
<p usiAlign="center" usi-text>Paragraph Text Content</p>
<p usiAlign="right" usi-text>Paragraph Text Content</p>
<p usiAlign="justify" usi-text>Paragraph Text Content</p>
```

## Color
Campfire has a [base color system](https://ui.wldgrb.com/?path=/story/design-colors--page) that is used for all components. We can use these colors to
make sure we stay consistent with our design. This can be accomplished by using the color keywords. In the event that a custom color is needed, we can use
the hexadecimal color value.

> Make sure the octothorpe is included in the hexadecimal value.

> **Note:** The color system is not yet complete. We are working on it.

```html
<p usiColor="primary" usi-text>Primary Blue Text</p>
<p usiColor="white" usi-text>White Text</p>
<p usiColor="#00A5E0" usi-text>A Hex Value Text</p>
```

## Font Size
Campfire has a [font size system](https://ui.wldgrb.com/?path=/story/design-typography--page) that is used for all text. Different circumstances call for
different font sizes, so we made this easy to adjust. In the same way colors can be customized, so can font sizes. When using a custom value, it is okay to
omit the unit since it is assumed to be pixels.

> When providing a number, the Angular bracket syntax will need to be used.

```html
<p usiSize="sm" usi-text>Small Text</p>
<p usiSize="xl" usi-text>Extra Large Text</p>
<p [usiSize]="36" usi-text>36px Text</p>
```

## Transformations
The most basic text transformations are included in the text module. These transformations can be applied to any valid HTML.

```html
<p usiTransform="uppercase" usi-text>Uppercase Text</p>
<p usiTransform="lowercase" usi-text>Lowercase Text</p>
<p usiTransform="capitalize" usi-text>Capitalized Text</p>
<p usiTransform="none" usi-text>No Transformations Text</p>
```

## Inheritance
In the event that the text needs to inherit from a parent element, we can use the inherit attribute. This will apply to the font family, font size, font
weight, and line height. This is done through a boolean, so it can omit the value.

```html
<p usiColor="success" [usiSize]="36" usi-text>
  <span [usiWeight]="900" usiInherit usi-text>Inherited Text</span>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 38px; line-height: 1.8;">
  <span usiInherit usi-text>Inherited Text</span>
</p>
```

## Inline
Line heights are automatically set at 1.2, but sometimes we need to set the line height to 1. This sets the line height to be exactly the height of the text.
In most cases, this should only be done when there is no text wrapping; otherwise, the text may become difficult to read and/or letters that are too tall may
be cut off.

```html
<article>
  <h1 usi-title>Weather forecast for Seattle</h1>

  <article>
    <h2 usi-title>03 March 2018</h2>
    <p usiInline usi-text>Rain.</p>
  </article>
</article>
```

## Line Clamping
Sometimes we need to limit the number of lines that are displayed. Line clamping at anything more than one line uses the `-webkit-line-clamp` property. This
property is implemented in all WebKit-based browsers but may not work in other browsers. Make sure to check
[Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_-webkit-line-clamp) to see if the property is supported.

```html
<div style="width: 50px;">
  <p [usiLineClamp]="2" usi-text>Very Very Very Very Very Very Very Long Text</p>
</div>
```

## Underlined Text
Underlined text creates an easy way to emphasize certain text.

```html
<p usiUnderline usi-text>Underlined Text</p>
```

## Customization
Campfire text was made to be easily customizable. Styling a piece of text is as simple as just adding a class to the tag or overriding our CSS variables in the
root selector. The list of overridable variables is as follows:

```css
:root {
  --text-base-color: var(--black);
}
```

```html
<p class="text" usi-text>Paragraph Text</p>
```
