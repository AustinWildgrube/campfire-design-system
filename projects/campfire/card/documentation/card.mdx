# Cards
A card is a UI design pattern that groups related information in a flexible-sized container. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable
information. Elements, like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

> This is a work in progress and will be updated with additional functionality in the future.

```html
<usi-card>
  CONTENT HERE
