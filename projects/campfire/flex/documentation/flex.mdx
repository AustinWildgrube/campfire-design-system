```ts
import { UsiFlexModule } from 'usi-campfire/flex';
```

# Flex
The Campfire flex component is an HTML implementation of the flex layout system. It is based on the
[Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and
[Flexbox Layout](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox-layout/) specifications. This component was added
to the Campfire Design System to provide a flexible and extensible flex layout system without having to repeat the same
CSS properties over and over again.

```html
<usi-flex>
  <app-child-component></app-child-component>
</usi-flex>
```

## Align
Align sets the [align-items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items) CSS property. The default is
`start` but the other options are: `initial`, `inherit`, `unset`, `start`, `center`, `end`, `baseline`, `stretch`.

```html
<usi-flex usiAlign="center">
  <app-child-component></app-child-component>
</usi-flex>
```

## Direction
Direction determines the [direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction) in which the flex
items are laid out. The default direction is `row` but the normal flex directions can be used as well: `row-reverse`,
`column`, `column-reverse`.

```html
<usi-flex usiDirection="column">
  <app-child-component></app-child-component>
</usi-flex>
```

## Grow
Grow will stretch the flex child to fill the available space; this is applied to all the children in the flex container.
The width will need to be set on the parent otherwise it is assumed the flex container is 100% width.

```html
<usi-flex usiGrow>
  <app-child-component></app-child-component>
</usi-flex>
```

## Justify
Justify sets the [justify-content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content) CSS property. There
is no default value for justify. The other options are: `initial`, `inherit`, `unset`, `start`, `center`, `end`,
`between`, `around`, `evenly`.

```html
<usi-flex usiJustify="center">
  <app-child-component></app-child-component>
</usi-flex>
```

## Wrap
Wrap determines the [flex-wrap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap) CSS property. By default the
children will wrap once they fill the available space. The `usiNoWrap` boolean property will prevent the children from
wrapping, therefore they will overflow.

```html
<usi-flex usiNoWrap>
  <app-child-component></app-child-component>
</usi-flex>
```

## Spacing
Spacing will set the [gap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gap) between the flex children. The Campfire
default is `24px` between children for desktop layouts, `20px` for tablet layouts and `16px` for mobile layouts. The
spacing can be set to any value if the defaults are not preferred. The spacing will be the same for all the children in
the flex container.

> It is assumed that the value provided to `usiSpacing` is a `px` value.

```html
<usi-flex [usiSpacing]="98">
  <app-child-component></app-child-component>
</usi-flex>
```
