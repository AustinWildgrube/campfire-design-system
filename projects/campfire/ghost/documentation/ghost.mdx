```ts
import { UsiGhostModule } from 'usi-campfire/ghost';
```

# Ghost
A skeleton screen is an animated placeholder that simulates the layout of a website while data is being loaded by using ghost elements. They let the user know
that some content is loading and, more importantly, provide an indication of what is loading, whether it's an image, text, card, and so on. This gives the user
the impression that the website is faster because they already know what type of content is loading before it appears. This is referred to as perceived
performance.

```html
<usi-ghost></usi-ghost>
```

## Inline
By default, the ghost will be a block element. If you want to use it inline, you can use the `usiInline` attribute.

```html
<usi-ghost usiInline></usi-ghost>
```

## Types
The ghost component supports a few different types of shapes that follow Campfire design guidelines. The default is a `square`, but you can also use a
`rectangle`, `circle`, `text`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, or `h6`.

```html
<usi-ghost usiType="text"></usi-ghost>
```

## Sizing
In order to accommodate a variety of shapes and sizes, the ghost elements should be configured using the usiWidth and usiHeight attributes. These attributes
can be set to the desired width and height of the element by utilizing the square bracket syntax and providing a px value.

```html
<usi-ghost [usiHeight]="99" [usiWidth]="99"></usi-ghost>
```

## Ghost Customization
Campfire ghost elements were made to be easily customizable. Styling a ghost element is as simple as just adding a class to the tag or overriding our CSS
variables in the root selector. The list of overridable variables is as follows:

```css
:root {
  --ghost-line-color: #676879;
  --ghost-background: #e6e9ef;
  --ghost-corner-radius: 3px;

  --ghost-height: 60px;
  --ghost-width: 60px;

  --ghost-width--rectangle: 120px;

  --ghost-height--circle: 60px;
  --ghost-width--circle: 60px;
  --ghost-corner-radius--circle: 50%;
}
```

```html
<usi-ghost class="custom-ghost"></usi-ghost>
```
