# Date Picker
A date picker, popup calendar, date and time picker, or time picker is a graphical user interface widget that allows the user to select a date from a calendar
and/or time from a time range. The use of a datepicker allows the developer to control the consistency of the date format and the date range.

The date picker component is a wrapper around the `<usi-input>` component. This means that attributes specified in the `<usi-input>` component are also
available in the `<usi-datepicker>` component. This includes the following attributes:

  * `usiPlaceholder` - The placeholder text of the select component.
  * `usiLabel` - The label text of the select component.
  * `usiDisabled` - Whether the select component is disabled.
  * `usiRequired` - Whether the select component is required.
  * `usiError` - The error message to display when the select component is invalid.
  * `usiForceError` - Whether to display the error message even when the select component is valid.
  * `usiHint` - The hint text to display below the select component.

```html
<usi-datepicker usiPlaceholder="placeholder" usiLabel="label"></usi-datepicker>
```

## Formatting Dates
The date picker component uses the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) library to format dates. The `<usi-datepicker>` component will accept any format that Day.js
supports. A list of these formats can be found [here](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format). The localized formats are also supported. Strings may be
added to the dates by using square brackets. For example, `[on]` will add the word "on" to the date. The following example will display the date as
"on 12/25/2019".

```html
<usi-datepicker usiFormat="[on] MM/DD/YYYY"></usi-datepicker>
```

There are two different formatting options. The first, being `usiDateFormat` is how the date within the input is displayed, and the second is
`usiDateOutputFormat`. By default, the `<usi-datepicker>` will use `'L'` as the default output format and `MM/DD/YYYY` as the default output format.

```html
<usi-datepicker usiDateFormat="LL" usiDateOutputFormat="dd, MMMM D YYYY"></usi-datepicker>
```

## Selection Modes
The `<usi-datepicker>` component has three different selection modes: `single`, `multiple`, and `range`. The first is the default mode, which is single day
selection. This allows the user to choose one day after which will close the date picker. If the user opens the date picker again and chooses a different date,
the value will also change. The second mode is a multi-day selection, which allows the user to choose multiple days. The selection of dates will be output in an
array. The third mode is range selection. This allows the user to choose a range of dates. The selection of dates will be output in an array, with the first
value being the start date and the second value being the end date.

```html
<usi-datepicker usiSelectionMode="multiple"></usi-datepicker>
```

## Localization
The `<usi-datepicker>` component supports localization. The default language is English, but the language can be changed by setting the `usiLocalization`
attribute. Since we are using Day.js for localization, the supported languages can be found [here](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs/tree/dev/src/locale).

```html
<!-- Mexico Spanish Localization -->
<usi-datepicker usiLocalization="es-mx"></usi-datepicker>
```

## Disabling Dates
Currently, there are three different ways to disable dates. The first way is to disable specific days of the week using the `usiDisabledDays` attribute. This
attribute takes an array of numbers, where 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, and so on. Using this method will disable the specified day every week.

```html
<!-- Disables Sundays and Fridays -->
<usi-datepicker usiDisabledDays="[0, 5]"></usi-datepicker>
```

The second way to disable dates is to disable specific dates using the `usiDisabledDates` attribute. This attribute takes an array of dates and will only
disable the specified dates.

```ts
oneDayAgo: Date = new Date(new Date().setDate(new Date().getDate() - 1));
oneDayInTheFuture: Date = new Date(new Date().setDate(new Date().getDate() + 1));

disabledDates: Date[] = [this.oneDayAgo, this.oneDayInTheFuture];
```

```html
<usi-datepicker [usiDisabledDates]="disabledDates"></usi-datepicker>
```

The third way to disable dates is by setting a minimum and/or maximum date using the `usiMinDate` and `usiMaxDate` attributes. This will disable all dates
before the minimum and all dates after the maximum.

```ts
fiveDaysAgo: Date = new Date(new Date().setDate(new Date().getDate() - 5));
fiveDaysInTheFuture: Date = new Date(new Date().setDate(new Date().getDate() + 5));
```

```html
<usi-datepicker [usiMinDate]="fiveDaysAgo" [usiMaxDate]="fiveDaysInTheFuture"></usi-datepicker>
```

## Multiple Months
Occasionally, it is necessary to display more than one month at a time. For example, if you are displaying a date picker for a date range, you may want to show
two or three months at a time. This can be done by setting the `usiNumberOfMonths` attribute to the number of months you want to display.

```html
<usi-datepicker [usiNumberOfMonths]="3"></usi-datepicker>
```

## Start Day of the Week
By default, the date picker will start on Sunday. This can be changed by setting the `usiStartOfWeek` attribute to the day you want to start on. This attribute
can either take the English lowercase name of the day or the number of the day. 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, and so on.

```html
<!-- Starts on Monday -->
<usi-datepicker usiFirstDayOfWeek="monday"></usi-datepicker>
<usi-datepicker [usiFirstDayOfWeek]="1"></usi-datepicker>
```

## Start View
By default, the date picker will start on the day view with the current month and year selected. This can be changed by setting the `usiView` attribute. This
will open the calendar to the selected view **only** on the first open. After the first open, the calendar will open to the last view that was selected by the
user. The values for this attribute are `day`, `month`, and `year`.

```html
<usi-datepicker usiView="month"></usi-datepicker>
```

## Customization
The date picker was made to be easily customizable. Styling the date picker is as simple as just adding a class onto the tag or overriding our CSS variables in
the root selector. The list of overridable variables are as follows:

```css
:root {
    /* Date Picker */
  --date-picker-headings-text-color: var(--gray);

  --date-picker-direction-icons-text-color: var(--gray);
  --date-picker-view-icon-text-color: var(--black);

  --date-picker-data-text-color: var(--black);
  --date-picker-data-text-color--disabled: var(--gray);
  --date-picker-data-text-color--other-month: var(--gray);

  --date-picker-data-background-color--hover: #F5F5F5;
  --date-picker-data-border-color--hover: #F5F5F5;
  --date-picker-data-text-color--hover: var(--black);

  --date-picker-data-background-color--selected: var(--primary);
  --date-picker-data-border-color--selected: var(--primary);
  --date-picker-data-text-color--selected: var(--white);

  --date-picker-data-border-color--today: var(--primary);
  --date-picker-data-text-color--today: var(--primary);
}
```

```html
<usi-datepicker class="custom-datepicker"></usi-datepicker>
```
