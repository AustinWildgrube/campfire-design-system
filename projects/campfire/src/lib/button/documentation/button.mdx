```ts
import { UsiButtonModule } from '@campfire/button';
```

# Buttons
Buttons execute an action, either in the background or foreground of an experience. Different button
categories help guide users through certain actions. Buttons express what action will occur when the
user clicks or touches it either by text, icon, or both. Additional meaning can be derived from the
button variant and size.

USI buttons are called via the `usi-button` directive. They then have custom attributes that may be used along with it.
The standard USI button is called as:

```html
<button usi-button>
  Button Text
</button>

<a href="#" usi-button>
  Anchor Text
</a>
```

## Button Types
Breakfast comes with three different button types. They are provided to give a visual distinction between the
priority or hierarchy of the buttons in the application.

### Primary
Primary buttons are USI's default button. It is designed to look heavy on purpose. They direct the userâ€™s attention to
the primary action the application is suggesting that the user take.

```html
<button usi-button>
  Primary Button
</button>
```

### Secondary
Secondary buttons provide a lighter weight button style. They are used to indicate a secondary action that compliments a
primary action or to reduce visual noise when there are many actions of equal importance on the page.

```html
<button usiType="secondary" usi-button>
  Secondary Button
</button>
```

### Transparent button
Transparent buttons are used in multiple scenarios. They can be used as tertiary buttons. They can also be used for
links because they are different from content in style and recognizable as buttons alongside content. USI buttons will
accept the `href` attribute like normal anchor tags.

> It is ***highly*** recommended using an anchor tag if combining a transparent button with a link to comply with
> accessibility guidelines.

```html
<button usiType="transparent" usi-button>
  Transparent Button
</button>

<a href="https://starwars.com/" usiType="transparent" usi-button>
  Transparent Anchor
</a>
```

## Button Sizes
Breakfast offers three button sizes:
- Small height of 1.875rem (30px)

```html
<button usiSize="small" usi-button>
  Small Text
</button>
```

- Default height of 2.375rem (38px)

```html
<button usi-button>
  Default Text
</button>
```

- Large height of 2.75rem (44px)

```html
<button usiSize="large" usi-button>
  Large Button
</button>
```

## Button Colors
USI buttons use the primary Ungerboeck blue `#0067b1`. There is also a white variant that is provided in the case of an
alternate colored background.

```html
<button usiColor="white" usi-button>
  Block Button
</button>
```

## Block Buttons
Block buttons will almost never be used in a desktop or tablet application. The main use for a block button comes with
mobile applications. Usually this replaces the default button size throughout the application.

```html
<button usi-button usiBlock>
  Block Button
</button>
```

## Icon Buttons
Icons can be used inside buttons to decorate the call-to-action with a visual indicator. Icons should be used alongside
text that clearly indicates what the interaction is expected to do.

Icons can be placed to the left or right of the button text. Icons should only appear on the right of the text if the
call-to-action would extend outside the current context, however. Examples include downloading a file, opening a new
window, or navigating the user to a page outside the application.

Sometimes an icon may be used on its own to indicate an action can be performed without explicitly saying so.
> When using an icon without any accompanying text it must be accompanied by an `aria-label` to allow screen readers to
> understand the meaning of the action.

> FontAwesome is currently the ***only*** icon library Breakfast supports.

```html
<button usi-button>
  <fa-icon [icon]="['fal', 'coffee']"></fa-icon> Buy Coffee
</button>

<button usi-button>
  <fa-icon [icon]="['fal', 'coffee']" aria-label="Buy coffee"></fa-icon>
</button>
```

## Disabled Buttons
Buttons may be disabled to indicate to a user that the call-to-action is unavailable. It should be clear to the user
why a button is disabled, however, and users should be directed how enable the call-to-action if that is possible.
Campfire buttons are disabled by using the attribute `usiDisabled`.

```html
<button usi-button usiDisabled>
  Disabled Button
</button>
```

## Button Loading
For buttons that communicate an action is being performed the spinner style loading should be used. Spinner style loading uses Angular object binding. For dynamic
loading times the square bracket syntax is required. If the button is to load indefinitely it can be called as a boolean value.

```ts
let isLoading = true;

// The button will load for 5 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  isLoading = false;
}, 5000);
```

```html
<button [usiLoading]="isLoading" usi-button>
  Loading Button
</button>
```

## Button Customization
USI buttons were made to be easily customizable. Styling a button is as simple as just adding a class onto the tag or
overriding our CSS variables in the root selector. The list of overridable variables are as follows:

```css
:root {
  --button-background-color: var(--primary);
  --button-border-color: var(--primary);
  --button-corner-radius: 3px;
  --button-text-color: var(--white);

  --button-background-color--hover: #00477A;
  --button-border-color--hover: #00477A;
  --button-text-color--hover: #00477A;

  --button-background-color--active: #003052;
  --button-border-color--active: #003052;
  --button-text-color--active: #003052;

  --button-shadow--focus: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 103, 177, 1);

  --button-text-color--visited: var(--white);
  --button-text-color--visited--secondary: var(--primary);

  --button-background-color--disabled: #EBEAEB;
  --button-border-color--disabled: #EBEAEB;
  --button-text-color--disabled: #515152;
  --button-background-color--disabled--submit: #D8D9DA;
  --button-border-color--disabled--submit: #D8D9DA;

  --button-text-color--white: var(--white);

  --button-text-color--secondary: var(--primary);
  --button-border-color--secondary--disabled: #ADADAE;
  --button-text-color--secondary--disabled: #515152;

  --button-text-color--transparent: var(--primary);
  --button-border-color--hover--transparent: #00477A;
}
```


```html
<button class="custom-button" usi-button>
  Customizable Button
</button>
```
