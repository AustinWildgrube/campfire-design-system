# Avatars
An avatar is a visual representation of a user or group. Use of an avatar can help people efficiently identify another
person or company within the platform. Where appropriate, link the avatar to a context-specific view of that individual
or company such as a settings page or a profile page.

```html
<usi-avatar></usi-avatar>
```

## Types
There are three main types of content that can be embedded into an avatar: image, icon, text. It is best practice using
an image within an avatar. When that is not possible text would be the second most desirable option leaving an icon
as the last option.

### Image
The image is the most common type of avatar. The Campfire avatar can take an image from a relative path or a URL. It is
usually best to use a headshot of a person or the logo of a company. Keep in mind that avatars are limited in size so
it is best to keep the image to a minimum.

> When using an image it is best to pair it with an alt text that describes the image.

```html
<usi-avatar usiSrc="https://via.placeholder.com/150" usiAlt="150x150 gray placeholder"></usi-avatar>
```

### Text
When there is no personal photo to show, use initials. Because personal names differ around the world, consider avoiding
using initials that may not represent an individual accurately. We tend to use the first letter of each space-separated
word for initials. You may need to resize the initials text for more than 4 names.

```html
<usi-avatar usiText="ES"></usi-avatar>
```

### Icons
If neither an image nor text is available it is appropriate to use an icon as a placeholder. Right now the only icons
that can be used with Campfire Design System is **FontAwesome**.

```html
<usi-avatar usiIcon="user"></usi-avatar>
```

## Sizes
Campfire Design System provides a set of sizes for avatars. The default size is `md` and the available sizes are: `xs`,
`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`.

```html
<usi-avatar usiSize="xs"></usi-avatar>
<usi-avatar usiSize="sm"></usi-avatar>
<usi-avatar></usi-avatar>
<usi-avatar usiSize="lg"></usi-avatar>
<usi-avatar usiSize="xl"></usi-avatar>
<usi-avatar usiSize="xxl"></usi-avatar>
```

## Loading
An avatar can use ghost loading which should ***only*** occur on the pages initial load into the DOM. Ghosting uses
Angular object binding. For dynamic loading times the square bracket syntax is required. If the avatar is to load
indefinitely it can be called as a boolean value.

```ts
let isGhosting = true;

// Avatar will load for 5 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  isGhosting = false;
}, 5000);
```

```html
<usi-avatar [usiGhost]="isGhosting" usiText="ES">
  Ghosting Button
</usi-avatar>
```

## Customization
Campfire avatars were made to be easily customizable. Styling an avatar is as simple as just adding a class onto the tag
or overriding our CSS variables in the root selector. The list of overridable variables are as follows:

```css
:root {
  --avatar-background-color: var(--white);
  --avatar-text-color: #003052;
  --avatar-icon-text-color: var(--gray);
  --avatar-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, .32);

  --avatar-corner-radius--square: 3px;
}
```

```html
<usi-avatar class="custom-avatar" usiText="ES"></usi-avatar>
```
