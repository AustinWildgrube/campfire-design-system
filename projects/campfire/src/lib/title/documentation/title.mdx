```ts
import { UsiTitleModule } from '@campfire/title';
```

# Titles
The title's module was created as an easy way to apply Campfire titles to the application you are working on. This way
titles can have the correct color, font size, font family, and line height without having to worry about adding the
correct class every time.

```html
<h1 usi-title>Title</h1>
```
## Order
Campfire titles use a directive,so it is up to you to make sure they are
[semantically](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) correct. They follow order
of 1-6 respectively.

```html
<h1 usi-title>H1 Title</h1>
<h2 usi-title>H2 Title</h2>
<h3 usi-title>H3 Title</h3>
<h4 usi-title>H4 Title</h4>
<h5 usi-title>H5 Title</h5>
<h6 usi-title>H6 Title</h6>
```

## Alignment
To make aligning titles easier Campfire comes with an alignment attribute. This attribute can be used to align titles
to the left, center, right, or even justify them.

```html
<h1 usiAlign="center" usi-title>H1 Title</h1>
<h1 usiAlign="right" usi-title>H1 Title</h1>
<h1 usiAlign="justify" usi-title>H1 Title</h1>
```

## Display
Occasionally there will be titles that just need to be a bit bigger than an H1. This can be done by using a "display"
title. This type of title should almost always be used with an H1 tag.

```html
<h1 usiDisplay usi-title>H1 Title</h1>
```

## Customization
Campfire titles were made to be easily customizable. Styling a title is as simple as just adding a class onto the tag or
overriding our CSS variables in the root selector. The list of overridable variables are as follows:

```css
:root {
  --title-text-color: var(--black);
  --title-font-weight: 600;
}
```

```html
<h1 class="custom-title" usi-title>H1 Title</h1>
```
