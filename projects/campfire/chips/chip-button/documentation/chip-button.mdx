# Chips
Chip buttons are a great alternative to radio buttons when you want to display a list of options with a more visual and compact design. Radio buttons are ideal
for small lists of mutually exclusive options, but for larger lists or when the options are not mutually exclusive, chip buttons may be a better option. With
chip buttons, users can select multiple options at once by clicking on each chip.

To use chip buttons, you should always group them together using the `<usi-chip-group>` element. This is similar to a solo chip button, which is called using
the `<usi-chip>` element. You can also add custom attributes to the chip button element for additional functionality. However, keep in mind that it is best to
limit the number of options to a reasonable amount to prevent overwhelming the user with too many choices.

```html
<usi-chip usiValue="one">Chip Button Text</usi-chip>

<usi-chip-group>
  <usi-chip usiValue="one">Chip Button One</usi-chip>
  <usi-chip usiValue="two">Chip Button Two</usi-chip>
  <usi-chip usiValue="three">Chip Button Three</usi-chip>
</usi-chip-group>
```

## Chips in Forms
Campfire chip buttons can be used in reactive forms as well as in template driven forms via the methods below.

```ts
chipsNgModel: string = 'two';
chipsFormGroup: FormGroup;

constructor(private formBuilder: FormBuilder) {
  this.chipsFormGroup = this.formBuilder.group({
    controlOne: 'one'
  });
}
```

```html
<usi-chip-group [(ngModel)]="chipsNgModel">
  <usi-chip usiValue="one">Chip Button One</usi-chip>
  <usi-chip usiValue="two">Chip Button Two</usi-chip>
  <usi-chip usiValue="three">Chip Button Three</usi-chip>
</usi-chip-group>

<form [formGroup]="chipsFormGroup">
  <usi-radio-group formControlName="controlOne">
    <usi-chip usiValue="one">Chip Button One</usi-chip>
    <usi-chip usiValue="two">Chip Button Two</usi-chip>
    <usi-chip usiValue="three">Chip Button Three</usi-chip>
  </usi-radio-group>
</form>
```

## Chip Button Values
To assign a value to a chip button, simply use the `usiValue` attribute. This attribute is mandatory for all chip buttons, as it determines which option is
currently selected. It's important to note that the component will throw an error if a chip button is missing a value. While the value can be any type of data,
using strings or numbers is recommended for consistency and ease of use.

```html
<usi-chip usiValue="one">Chip Button One</usi-chip>
<usi-chip [usiValue]="2">Chip Button One</usi-chip>
<usi-chip [usiValue]="randomTypedObject">Chip Button One</usi-chip>
```

## Disabled Chip Buttons
You can disable chip buttons to signal to users that certain options are temporarily unavailable. However, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information
about why a chip button is disabled and how the user can enable it if possible. If all chip buttons in a group are disabled, you can use the usiDisabled
attribute on the group element. When this happens, it's recommended to display a message explaining why all options are disabled, and offer alternative options
or a timeframe for when the options will become available again.

```html
<usi-chip usiValue="one" usiDisabled>Chip Button One</usi-chip>

<usi-chip-group usiDisabled>
  <usi-chip usiValue="one">Chip Button One</usi-chip>
  <usi-chip usiValue="two">Chip Button Two</usi-chip>
  <usi-chip usiValue="three">Chip Button Three</usi-chip>
</usi-chip-group>
```

## Chip Customizations
Campfire chips were made to be easily customizable. Styling a chip is as simple as just overriding our CSS variables in the root selector. The list of
overridable variables are as follows:

```css
:root {
  --chip-background-color: var(--white);
  --chip-border-color: var(--gray);
  --chip-text-color: var(--black);
  --chip-corner-radius: 22px;

  --chip-background-color--disabled: #D8D9DA;
  --checkbox-border-color--focus: var(--primary);
  --checkbox-border-color--selected--focus: var(--black);

  --chip-background-color--selected: var(--primary);
  --chip-text-color--slected: var(--white);
}
```
