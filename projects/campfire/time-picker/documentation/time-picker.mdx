```ts
import { UsiTimePickerModule } from 'usi-campfire/time-picker';
```

# Time Picker
The Time Picker is an input field which accepts a value in HH:mm format. Currently, the Time Picker is built on top of the HTML time picker, using an input field
with type="time", which comes with some inherent limitations. In order to release a functional and stable Time Picker for immediate use, we decided to work
within these limitations with the intention of updating this module to a custom Time Picker in a future release. The current API was designed to avoid any
breaking changes with future versions of the Time Picker.

## Browser Support
Because browsers' implementations of the native time picker vary, this component may not be fully accessible in all cases. Chrome/Edge, Safari and Firefox all
support the Time Picker, but the user experience differs browser-to-browser.

```html
<usi-time-picker usiLabel="Start Time"></usi-time-picker>
```

## Disabled Time Pickers
Time Pickers may be disabled to indicate to a user that the current action is unavailable. It should be clear to the user why a Time Picker is disabled, however,
and users should be directed how enable the input if that is possible. Campfire Time Pickers are disabled by using the `usiDisabled` attribute.

```html
<usi-time-picker usiLabel="Start Time" usiDisabled></usi-time-picker>
```

## Required Time Pickers
Time Pickers can be required by adding the `usiRequired` attribute to the `usi-time-picker` element. This will ensure that the user provides a value before
submitting the form.

```html
<usi-time-picker usiLabel="Start Time" usiRequired></usi-time-picker>
```

## Label
The `usiLabel` attribute is used to provide a label for the Time Picker. When a Campfire Time Picker is being focused the label will float
above like our traditional inputs. Labels are required as they provide crucial information to the users.

```html
<usi-time-picker usiLabel="Start Time"></usi-time-picker>
```

## Default Values
A lot of the time pickers already have had information provided to them. This is common when a user is to edit some information they have previously provided.
This is done by setting the `usiValue` attribute. If the Time Picker is connected to a form the value will be set there as well. The value must be provided in a
valid 24-hour format (HH:mm).

```html
<usi-time-picker usiLabel="Start Time" usiValue="14:35"></usi-time-picker>
```

## Customization
Campfire time pickers were made to be easily customizable. Styling a time picker is as simple as just adding a class onto the tag or overriding our CSS variables
in the root selector. Since time pickers are just an extension of our normal input the list of overridable variables are the same:

```css
:root {
  --input-min-width: 135px;
  --input-background-color: var(--white);
  --input-border: 1px solid var(--gray);
  --input-corner-radius: 3px;
  --input-text-color: var(--black);

  --input-background--disabled: #f5f5f5;
  --input-border-color--disabled: #717073;
  --input-text-color--disabled: #515152;

  --input-outline-color--focus: var(--primary);

  --input-border-color--error: var(--error);
  --input-outline-color--error: var(--error);

  --input-placeholder-color: var(--gray);

  --input-label-background-color--focus: var(--white);
  --input-label-text-color--focus: var(--primary);
  --input-label-text-color--focus--error: var(--error);

  --input-label-background-color--filled: var(--white);
  --input-label-text-color--filled: var(--gray);
  --input-label-text-color--filled--error: var(--error);

  --input-label-text-color: var(--gray);
  --input-label-text-color--error: var(--error);
}
```

```html
<usi-time-picker class="custom-time-input" usiLabel="Start Time"></usi-time-picker>
```
