```ts
import { UsiTimePickerModule } from 'usi-campfire/time-picker';
```

# Time Picker
The Time Picker is an input field that accepts time values in the HH:mm format and supports both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats. In the Campfire time picker,
you can select the time interval from a dropdown or enter it manually in the input field. Once you select or enter a time, the Campfire time picker returns a
time object that provides the hours and minutes in the 24-hour format. You can access this return object by importing the `UsiTimePickerResult` interface.

```html
<usi-time-picker usiLabel="Start Time"></usi-time-picker>
```

## Disabling
Time Pickers may be disabled to indicate to a user that the current action is unavailable. It should be clear to the user why a time picker is disabled,
however, and users should be directed on how to enable the input if that is possible. Campfire time pickers are disabled by using the `usiDisabled` attribute.

```html
<usi-time-picker usiLabel="Start Time" usiDisabled></usi-time-picker>
```

## Required
Time Pickers can be required by adding the `usiRequired` attribute. This will ensure that the user provides a value before submitting the form.

```html
<usi-time-picker usiLabel="Start Time" usiRequired></usi-time-picker>
```

## Label
The `usiLabel` attribute is used to provide a label for the time picker. Campfire time pickers will always have a floating label. Labels are required as they
provide crucial information to the users.

```html
<usi-time-picker usiLabel="Start Time"></usi-time-picker>
```

## Default Value
A lot of time pickers already have had information provided to them. This is common when a user wants to edit some information they have previously provided.
This is done by setting the `usiValue` attribute. If the time picker is connected to a form, the value will be set there as well. The value must be provided in
a valid 24-hour format (HH:mm).

```html
<usi-time-picker usiLabel="Start Time" usiValue="14:35"></usi-time-picker>
```

## Start and End Times
Start and end times can be added to Campfire time pickers using the `usiStart` and `usiEnd` attributes. The provided values will need to be of type string and
presented in a 24-hour format, for example, 13:59. For manual input values, it will run validations to make sure it is in the correct time range, and for
dropdowns or intervals, it will only show times in between the provided values.

```html
<usi-time-picker usiLabel="Start Time" usiStart="08:00" usiEnd="16:45"></usi-time-picker>
```

## Manual Entry
The Campfire time picker allows you to enter a time by default, but this behavior can be changed if needed. To disable manual entry, you can add the
`usiManualEntry` attribute and set its value to false. This attribute enables an opt-out behavior, meaning that manual entry is turned on by default but can be
disabled as needed.

```html
<usi-time-picker usiLabel="Start Time" [usiManualEntry]="false"></usi-time-picker>
```

## Dropdowns and Intervals
Campfire makes time selection easier with a dropdown that functions much like the browser's native dropdown. To add this feature to the time picker, simply
include the `usiShowDropdown` attribute. By default, the dropdown displays 12-hour time with 1-minute intervals and an AM/PM selector. If you need to customize
the intervals, you can add the `usiInterval` attribute as well.

```html
<usi-time-picker usiLabel="Start Time" [usiInterval]="20" usiShowDropdown></usi-time-picker>
```

## 24 Format
To use the 24-hour time format, simply add the `usiTwentyFourHour` attribute. This setting will adjust the dropdown and change the format of manual entry to use
the 24-hour clock.

```html
<usi-time-picker usiLabel="Start Time" [usiInterval]="20" usiTwentyFourHour></usi-time-picker>
```

## Customization
Campfire time pickers were made to be easily customizable. Styling a time picker is as simple as just adding a class to the tag or overriding our CSS variables
in the root selector. Since time pickers are just an extension of our normal input, the list of overridable variables is the same:

```css
:root {
  --input-min-width: 135px;
  --input-background-color: var(--white);
  --input-border: 1px solid var(--gray);
  --input-corner-radius: 3px;
  --input-text-color: var(--black);

  --input-background--disabled: #f5f5f5;
  --input-border-color--disabled: #717073;
  --input-text-color--disabled: #515152;

  --input-outline-color--focus: var(--primary);

  --input-border-color--error: var(--error);
  --input-outline-color--error: var(--error);

  --input-placeholder-color: var(--gray);

  --input-label-background-color--focus: var(--white);
  --input-label-text-color--focus: var(--primary);
  --input-label-text-color--focus--error: var(--error);

  --input-label-background-color--filled: var(--white);
  --input-label-text-color--filled: var(--gray);
  --input-label-text-color--filled--error: var(--error);

  --input-label-text-color: var(--gray);
  --input-label-text-color--error: var(--error);
}
```

```html
<usi-time-picker class="custom-time-input" usiLabel="Start Time"></usi-time-picker>
```
